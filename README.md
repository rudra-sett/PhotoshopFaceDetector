# PhotoshopFaceDetector

This is an Android app that allows the user to input an image of a face and then determine the probability of that image being photoshopped. I should also mention that the processing done to determine this probability is from this project: https://github.com/peterwang512/FALdetector

Important notes: 

This app is just enough to be techinically "functional." There will be future updates:

1. Better UI
2. Easier ways to access this app and input images
3. The project that this app is derived from also includes a function to generate an image of exactly where edits probably were made. This function hasn't been implemented in this app, yet.
